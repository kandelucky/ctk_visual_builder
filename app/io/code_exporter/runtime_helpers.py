"""Runtime helper text for the exported `.py` file.

Currently holds the ``CircularProgress`` inline runtime — read via
``inspect.getsource`` so a single edit in ``app/widgets/runtime/``
propagates to every export. (Font registration moved to ctkmaker-core
5.4.16's ``customtkinter.register_project_fonts`` — exports now call
the fork API directly instead of inlining the loader body.)
